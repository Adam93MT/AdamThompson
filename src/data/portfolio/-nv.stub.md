# Defining what's important
We approached major stakeholders within and outside the organization, particularly our coaches who work with schools to establish best practices. These people were able to name data points that are important for identifying areas a school might want to focus on, and monitoring the performance of a school.

After gathering feedback on which metrics can help track a school's performance, we asked coaches to arrange the data labels in an understandable way. To identify this natural information architecture, I decided to run a card-sorting exercise. To do this I put each metric into an Airtable, and printed off each one as a card. I then asked each coach to sort these cards in whatever way made sense to them.

To little surprize, our coaches consistently organized the cards roughly in line with our targeted meetings between schools and coaches to discuss major areas for improvement, called [Strategic Data Checkins](https://sdc.newvisions.org). To confirm this organization scheme, we performed the same exercise with other stakeholders who were less familiar with the SDC process. 

While we were able to identify a logical way of ordering key metrics, we were unfortunately not able to determine which data points were more important to drive conversations in schools. The product team was hesitant to make a call on a hierarchy of these metrics, in fear of hiding potentially important information from schools. We decided to present all the data in an initial version of the dashboard, and monitor which data points proved to be most valuable to schools.
