## I'm Adam, a developer & designer based in New York building thoughtful and accessible web & mobile experiences.


<!-- I'm an engineer at the intersection of design and development. With experience in UX since 2013, and an education in [Systems Design Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/about-systems-design-engineering/what-systems-design-engineering) I approach problems holistically, design a complete solution, and execute effectively. -->

I'm Currently a UI engineer and product designer at [New Visions for Public Schools](https://newvisions.org), I build and maintain the design system and component library, evangelize front-end & UX best practices, and design and prototype new features for over 750 public schools in New York City.

<!-- I've worked at MUSIC Group, Noom, KnowRoaming, Sony and Zynga, conducting market and customer research, developing user flows and wireframes, refining UIs, and testing prototypes. My company Chameleon Hearing Protection won the [Norman Esch Entrepreneurship award](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/news/six-teams-win-10000-each-annual-esch-awards) in March 2017, and was a semi-finalist for AC JumpStart. -->

### I love singing and making music.

I'm currently tenor section leader in [The SymphoNYChorus](https://www.thesymphonychorus.com/), and I was the baritone section leader for the ICCA finalist group [The Water Boys](http://www.570news.com/2017/04/05/uw-capella-group-shot-world-title/).
