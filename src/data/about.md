I'm a product designer & UX engineer at [New Visions for Public Schools](https://newvisions.org), where I design new features for our expanding network of schools in New York. I also and build and document the component library and design system for the school facing data portal.

I'm at the intersection of Design & Engineeringâ€”my education in [Systems Design Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/about-systems-design-engineering/what-systems-design-engineering) allows me to approach problems from a holistic perspective, design a complete solution, and execute that solution effectively.

<!-- I've worked at MUSIC Group, Noom, KnowRoaming, Sony and Zynga, conducting market and customer research, developing user flows and wireframes, refining UIs, and testing prototypes. My company Chameleon Hearing Protection won the [Norman Esch Entrepreneurship award](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/news/six-teams-win-10000-each-annual-esch-awards) in March 2017, and was a semi-finalist for AC JumpStart. -->

When I'm not making software, I enjoy writing, arranging, and playing music. I'm currently tenor section leader in [The SymphoNYChorus](https://www.thesymphonychorus.com/), and in April 2017 I had the amazing opportunity to sing at the Beacon Theatre in New York with the [Water Boys](http://www.570news.com/2017/04/05/uw-capella-group-shot-world-title/) for the ICCA finals.
