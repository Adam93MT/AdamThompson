I'm a user researcher, product designer, and graduate from [Systems Design Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/about-systems-design-engineering/what-systems-design-engineering) at the University of Waterloo, with a minor in Cognitive Science. My multidisciplinary engineering background allows me to bring a holistic process to everything I design. 

I've worked at MUSIC Group, Noom, KnowRoaming, Sony and Zynga, conducting market and customer research, developing user flows and wireframes, refining UIs, and testing prototypes. My company Chameleon Hearing Protection won the [Norman Esch Entrepreneurship award](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/news/six-teams-win-10000-each-annual-esch-awards) in March 2017, and was a semi-finalist for AC JumpStart.

When I'm not making products, I enjoy writing, arranging, and playing music. In April 2017 I had the amazing opportunity to sing at the Beacon Theatre in New York with the[ Water Boys](http://www.570news.com/2017/04/05/uw-capella-group-shot-world-title/) for the ICCA finals.
