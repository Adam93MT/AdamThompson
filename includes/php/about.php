		Hi! I'm Adam, currently in my <? echo $term;?> term of Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I'm passionate about products, and their design, usability and functionality. I love a project that can take advantage of both my artsy and nerdy sides. In the past I have worked at KnowRoaming and Sony as a User Experience designer, and have worked on several freelance projects.</p>
