				<p>
					I'm a product designer, and recent grad from <a target="_blank" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/about-systems-design-engineering/what-systems-design-engineering">Systems Design Engineering</a> at the University of Waterloo, with a minor in Cognitive Science. My multidisciplinary background allows me to bring a holistic process to everything I design. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I've designed at Noom, KnowRoaming, Sony and Zynga, conducting user research, developing user flows and wireframes, refining UIs, and testing prototypes. I recently won the <a target="_blank" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/news/six-teams-win-10000-each-annual-esch-awards">Norman Esch Entrepreneurship award</a> with Chameleon Hearing Protection.

					When I'm not making products, I enjoy making music. In April 2017 I had the amazing opportunity to sing at the Beacon Theatre in New York with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.570news.com/2017/04/05/uw-capella-group-shot-world-title/">Water Boys</a> for the ICCA finals.
