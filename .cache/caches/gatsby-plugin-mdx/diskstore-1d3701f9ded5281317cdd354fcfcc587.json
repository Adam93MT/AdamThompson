This is typically the use case of the power-user who has a great amount of experience with the data at hand. These users are able to read more into the data and take actions based on past experience. In effect, the Observation dashboard offloads judgement and decision making to the user.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Alternatively, there are many cases where a user does not want to, or lacks the experience to parse what the data means to them. In this case the users should be prompted to take a specific action. In our case, we have 30 years of educational systems experience in place, and are in great position to encourage a user to take specific actions in a dashboard.`}</p>\n    <p>{`By highlighting the differences between these two dashboard types, a designer can leverage this framework to speed up design of new dashboard sections by designing for a specific use case.
