I maintain a UI component library, re-wrote the core CSS architecture, and built a new landing page for the <a href=\"https://portal.newvisions.org\">New Visions Portal</a>.</p>\n<p>But more precisely, I'm a UX engineer in that I apply engineering problem-solving to holistically solve complex interaction problems. The <a href=\"./portfolio/newvisions\">New Visions dashboard framework</a>, and the <a href=\"./portfolio/noom\">Noom food logging workflow</a> are just two examples of tackling tough problems through analysis and creative problem solving. </p>\n<p>I'm at the intersection of design and engineering, with an education in <a href=\"https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/about-systems-design-engineering/what-systems-design-engineering\">Systems Design Engineering</a> and experience in UX since 2013. I approach problems holistically, design complete solutions, and execute them efficiently.</p>\n<!-- Currently a UI engineer at [New Visions for Public Schools](https://newvisions.org), I build and manage the design system and component library, prototype and design new features for over 750 public schools in New York City, and evangelize frontend and UX best practices. -->\n<!-- I've worked at MUSIC Group, Noom, KnowRoaming, Sony and Zynga, conducting market and customer research, developing user flows and wireframes, refining UIs, and testing prototypes. My company Chameleon Hearing Protection won the [Norman Esch Entrepreneurship award](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/news/six-teams-win-10000-each-annual-esch-awards) in March 2017, and was a semi-finalist for AC JumpStart. -->\n<!-- ### I love singing and making music. -->\n<!-- I'm currently tenor section leader in [The SymphoNYChorus](https://www.thesymphonychorus.com/), and I was the baritone section leader for the ICCA finalist group [The Water Boys](http://www.570news.com/2017/04/05/uw-capella-group-shot-world-title/). -->"}
