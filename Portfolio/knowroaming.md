[KnowRoaming](http://knowroaming.com) is a startup in Toronto, seeking to eliminate 'Bill Shock' from international roaming. They sell a SIM Sticker that sticks to your existing SIM card and acts as a second SIM while you're abroad. They connect you to a local network through the Sticker to save you money on roaming. Their iOS and Android apps are accout management tools, to setup your account, manage your balance and chack usage and rates.

I joined the KnowRoaming team in May 2014 as the company’s first User Experience designer. My primary task was to take their existing account-management app, and rework it to improve the flow and experience. In coordination with the stakeholders, COO, developers, and customer service, I reworked everything from the registration workflow, to the in app experience at home and abroad using the KnowRoaming SIM Sticker.

To start, I analyzed the existing app and noted what it does well, and where it fell short. Over the next few months I worked out sketches and wireframes, iterating  and discussing the designs every week. Once a basic workflow was decided, I began to work on the new visual style, and finally came up with a viable product near the end of my term there.

When I returned the following January, the product had been out for several several months, and user feedback was plentiful. I used this feedback, received from customer service, to improve on the design from the previous term. One of the most noteworthy improvements is the use of Phases - different use cases in the app corresponding to the user’s current situation - At Home, Abroad, and Back Home. I modified the existing home screen to display situational buttons that appear when needed, and disappear when not needed. For example, a user can’t setup their Roaming Data connection when they’re at home.

Among the other improvements were the Reload, ReachMe and Checkout workflow, the number purchasing workflow, and the appearance of the bottom tab bar
