SMRT WATR (pronounced "smart water") is an interactive fountain and mobile game IoT experiece. For our 3rd year engineering project, [Josh Bradshaw](http://joshbradshaw.ca), Emma Cooper, [Isaac Hunter](https://isaachunter.ca), Matt Jones, and Shubh Jagani and I designed and built a dynamic fountain which changes based on the results of a web-based quiz game. Users could sign in to the web app at [smrtwatr.ca](?p=smrtwatr), and join a quiz match with three other people. As a player answered a question correctly, their corner of the fountain would get higher in response. The player with the highest score after all questions could control the fountain for 30 seconds, selecting from a list of pre-set routines.
