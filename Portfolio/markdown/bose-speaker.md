# Bose Speaker

I sketched a speaker for a Reddit `/r/industrial_design` challenge in 2015, and based the shape of the speaker on the 'O' in the Bose logo. The hole created by the 'O' in the side is meant to be a type of handle to make holding carrying the device easier, and it has a power, and volume controls on the top. I created a model in Rhino to try and learn the software.
