#Falcon

My personal logo is based on the old heraldry of the Scottish and English Thompson's. I have wanted to design my own simple line logo for a while, so when I discovered what was on my family's crest last year at the CNE, I thought that a falcon might make for a pretty cool logo. I sketched a few designs on paper, and over several weeks removed unnecessary details, reducing the shape of the falcon to as few lines as possible.
