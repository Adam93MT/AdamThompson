## ReachMe

When redesigning the app architecture, I noticed there were several independent features that could be consolidated and given a new name. Together these features allowed users to be reached on their home number while abroad. I approached the CEO and COO about this idea and they approved. After some design and discussion with the marketing, ReachMe was born.
