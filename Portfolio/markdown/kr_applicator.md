#KnowRoaming Automatic Sticker Applicator

A small project I was tasked with at KnowRoaming was to conceptualize an automatic sticker applicator which can apply many KnowRoaming Smart SIMs in rapid succession. I used AutoCad and Inventor to create the 3D model and concept animations. The exported concept videos were used in stakeholder and investor meetings.
