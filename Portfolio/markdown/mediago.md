#MediaGo Concept UI

I worked at Sony Network Entertainment for my first UX design internship in the fall of 2013. While working there, I designed several concept images to improve the look and feel of the app. The version pictured got the best feedback throughout the office, however was not implemented due to a lack of resources in the department.
