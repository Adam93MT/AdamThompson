As a first full project with Arduino and low-level logic, I made a volume meter with two classmates. The device plugs into any audio source and outputs the relative volume on an array of LEDs. The device makes use of hardware interrupts to auto-calibrate to an appropriate base level. Developed for Arduino UNO in Arduino-flavoured C.
