## The simple metronome for easy band practice.

#### Most metronome apps have many irrelevant controls that can cause distractions when practicing. Tap Metronome has a simple interface to set or tap the tempo and start practicing.

#### Practicing to a metronome as a group can be difficult since everyone needs to be able to hear the click. Tap Metronome uses the screen as an indicator so everyone can stay in sync when making music. Just put your phone on a music stand, and jam away.

Tap Metronome was inspired while I was practicing with the Water Boys a cappella group. We were struggling to stay together, and couldn't all hear the metronome clicks while singing. We needed a way to stay in time, but not rely on being able to hear the clicks.

Now with Tap Metronome, you can put your phone on a music stand where everyone can see the beat.

I started Tap metronome as a Hack the North 2016 projects, and continued working on it in Fall 2017.
