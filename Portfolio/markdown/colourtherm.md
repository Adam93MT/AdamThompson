#Colour Thermometer

The <a terget='_blank' href='http://www.adamthompson.ca/ColourThermometer'>Colour Thermometer</a> is a web app I initially built in early 2015 that converts the specified location's temperature, weather conditions and current time as an hsl (hue, saturation, lightness) colour value, respectively. I had left it in a mostly working state, but I've recently made some modifications, and got it up and running again as of June 2017. The location text is editable, and there's also a 'shuffle' button to go to a random city. Since I don't have a SSL cert, most modern browsers will reject the request for location services automatically. <a href='https://github.com/Adam93MT/ColourThermometer'>Check it out on GitHub.</a> Inspired by <a href='http://thecolourclock.co.uk' target='_blank'>The Colour Clock.</a>
