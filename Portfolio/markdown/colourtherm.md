The <a terget='_blank' href='".$root_path."/ColourThermometer'>Colour Thermometer</a> is a web app I built initially in early of 2015 that converts the specified location's temperature, weather conditions and current time as an hsv (hue, saturation, variance) colour value, respectively. I've recently made some modifications, and got it up and running again in the summer of 2017. <a href='https://github.com/Adam93MT/ColourThermometer'>Check it out on GitHub.</a> Inspired by <a href='http://thecolourclock.co.uk' target='_blank'>The Colour Clock.</a>
