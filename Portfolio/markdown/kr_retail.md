## Retail Display

I designed and built a stand to display the SIM Stickers in retail stores. I took just over a week to move from concept sketches to this final prototype.

The prototyping phase was a long procedure since I had to experiment to get the front protrusion and front panel height just right. In the final drawings there are notes on which dimensions need to be lengthened to increase the capacity. (The prototypes were shorter in order to fit on one sheet of the cardboard that we had in the office).
