# KnowRoaming

## I made a case-based UI that displays only the important information.

### Users were never quite sure if their account was set up properly before traveling abroad. This made them uneasy and unsure whether to trust the product. 

### I overhauled the visual style, layout and architecture of the app to make it simpler, more understandable and more informative.
