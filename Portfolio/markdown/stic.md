#Ski Tip Connector (STiC)

For our first year design project, our team designed a ski tip connector to assist skiers with mental and physical disabilities more easily navigate the slopes. The design was considered by the Canadian Association for Disabled Skiing. Models were created using AutoCad and Inventor.

The mechanism is akin to the G6 guitar capo, which uses a wrap-spring-clutch to keep the device closed when in use, but allows it to quickly open by pressing the release lever
