##Main Site
I played a vital role in the redesign of KnowRoaming's new main site. In a meeting we discussed potentials to improve awareness of the KnowRoaming product and how to increase sales. I analyzed the current website and realized that there was little basic information about the product, and that a potential customer might not know enough about the product before they buy. We had statistics that viewers saw only half the page before leaving. That afternoon I sketched up a wireframe of a new website that improves on these issues. The goal of this redesign was to introduce the customer to the steps of using KnowRoaming (Application, Registration, Roaming, and Returning Home) one-by-one. By the time a visitor reaches the same section where they would have previously left, they have hopefully learned enough about the product to proceed.

After presenting the wireframe and making some modifications as recommended by the marketing team, we began development of a Beta site. A version of the new site is accessible as a special Airlines promotion mini-site at <a href='http://www.knowroaming.com/airlines' target='_blank'>knowroaming.com/airlines</a>. Before I left in May, we had a meeting to discuss next steps, and the design will be implemented on the main site within a month. The new site will have many metrics in place for user analysis and A/B testing.

## Athletes Signup Form

KnowRoaming created an athlete sponsorship program, targeting amateur athletes who cover the cost of travel (and roaming) on their own. I designed and built <a target='_blank' href='http://athletes.knowroaming.com'>athletes.knowroaming.com</a> as a simple mini-site and signup form for the KnowRoaming Athletes program.
